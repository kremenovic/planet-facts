## Overview

I used this challenge to practice my frontend skills and to build my first React application.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each planet page and toggle between "Overview", "Internal Structure", and "Surface Geology"

## My process

I analyzed designs to see what I have to implement. After that I started building the application. Using local data.json file I generated navigation items and I wanted to make it dynamic as much as I can. There are some classes and stylings that are added dynamically depending on which planet is active.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

It helped me to improve my React skills. It helped me to learn how to use data to dynamically make some elements.

### Useful resources

- [SASS Guidlines](https://sass-guidelin.es/#introduction) - This helped me to learn SASS file structuring, mixins etc.

## Installation

### `npm install`

This command installs a package and any packages that it depends on.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
